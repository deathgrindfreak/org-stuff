* Download Stored Procedure
  In order to lookup a stored procedure:
  
  + Go to XenApp -> Desktops -> Standard Desktop
  + Once the VM has booted, go the Reflections Workspace and click on
    the stored terminal session.
  + Enter login credentials
  + Enter '1' for the TSO (Not sure what that means)
  + The command 'tso vsp <STORED PROCEDURE NAME>' will bring up the
    stored procedure.
  + Copy the header name (it should be something along the lines of
    'SCLM.PERM.PROD.SOURCE(<PROCEDURE NAME>)')
  + Paste it in the 'input1' field of the ftp mainframe tool (make sure
    the login info is the mainframe login, not normal credentials).  
* Insert Comment into CM4A table 
  + Find the desired batch document comment id with:
    'select invc_num, batch_num, comnt_id from mc.lic_inv_hdr_bk2l
    where batch_num = <CURRENT_BATCH_NUMBER>'
  + Use the insert SQL statement: insert into MC.COMNT_CM4A values
    (<BATCH_DOC_NUM>, 0,'Test Comment', 'JCBELL',
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,'','');
  + Set the doc status of a batch document back to 'RL' with: update
    mc.lic_inv_hdr_bk2l set stat='RL' where batch_num=<BATCH_NUM> and
    invc_num=<BATCH_DOC_NUM>;
* Finding Errors in Mainframe (Error Log)
  + Login and type 1 for TSO
  + Enter 'tso wlmsrch'
