* Line Item Credits App

** Current Tasks
*** DONE The action listener for the item credits number throws an exception for each row entered (this is because initAddLic initializes the field to an empty string).  
    CLOSED: [2014-12-29 Mon 17:09]
*** DONE Also, lic is set to null in "doUpdateLic" in BatchDocPresenterImpl.  I think this is fine, but lic needs to be reinitialized somehow (for a new line item credit

    CLOSED: [2015-01-20 Tue 11:38]

*** TODO Saving a doc causes the save prompts for the leaving the current doc on tree and hitting the back button to pop up

|  11 | Batch                 | Open    | After pulling up a batch and then selecting create the Release is present and shouldn¡¦t be. |
|  12 | Batch Search          | Open    | On the Search screen force the input value into the Search By Creator field to be All Caps because the search did not find anything when searched for xxlic85. |
|  13 | Credit Entire Invoice | Closed? | On the menu, change ¡§Credit Invoice¡¨ to ¡§Credit Entire Invoice¡¨. |
|  14 | Batch Search          | Closed  | On the Search screen, add a ¡§reset¡¨ pushbutton to reset all fields. |
|  15 | Batch Invoice         | Closed  | After clicking on a batch and the Invoice screen opens, the focus between the Item Credit or ACD tab should be on the tab that contains the data.  If both tabs contain data then set the focus on the Item Credit tab. |

|  22 | Batch                 | Open    | Use the messages coming from MCOIC21               |
|  23 | Batch Invoice         | Open    | From William's 6/10 email: The current screens for CHB and CCH don¡¦t have entered amount, but they do have total item quantity and the screens compare the quantities like the current CCR screen checks that the amounts match.  I don¡¦t remember if we decided not to do that or if we asked any LIC clerks about it. |
|  24 | Batch Invoice         | Open    | From William's 6/26 email: One of the things the current screen does is check for a variance between the user entered amount and the system determine amount.  If the difference is over a specified percentage, the screen gives the user a warning and allows the user to override the warning and proceed with the insert/update.  In order to give the user the same ability on the new system, I think we should add an item level flag to the data sent to MCOIC24.  This of course, would require the new screen to have a way for the user to set the flag. |
|  25 | Batch Invoice         | Open    | what needs to happen to report and rollback batch invoice updates? (i.e. MCOIC24/35/26 failure with a specific item, return index? Rollback all update calls include MCOIC22? And MCOIC27?) |
