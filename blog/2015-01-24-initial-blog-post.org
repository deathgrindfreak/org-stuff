* Blogging
I feel that I am not a very good writer. This of course has to do with
the fact that I generally haven't practiced in well ... ever. Not that
my grammar or the structure in which I arrange essays is abhorrent,
it's just that like many science/tech minded students out there, I've
been under the illusion that writing is for right-brained English
majors and not left-brained Engineers.

However, upon beginning my programming career I've discovered that
most, if not all, good programmers tend to keep up-to-date blogs and
that I might as well join the party and keep one myself. Most of my
current blogging efforts will be spent compiling solutions to the
(in)famous [[http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/][Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs]], so there
probably won't be too many enlightening posts on other topics for a
bit.

Also, In case you're interested, this blog is powered (I use that word
loosely, since it is entirely static) by [[http://jekyllrb.com/][Jekyll]] and [[https://pages.github.com/][Github Pages]] and
is built using good 'ol [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs][Emacs]] and [[http://orgmode.org/][Org-Mode]].
