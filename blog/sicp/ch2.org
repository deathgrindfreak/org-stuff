These are my notes for Chapter 2 of the Structure and Interpretation
of Computer Programs. Since I started using org mode quite a bit after
I began SICP, I'll have to come back and transcribe the previous
sections at a later time.

One of the most important concepts in this section is the concept of
the "signal chain" as illustrated in fig. 2.7.  Of course this is
really a visualization of how programs are more conceptually tractable
when they are modularized appropriately (a concept that is hammered on
in the famous [[http://worrydream.com/refs/Hughes-WhyFunctionalProgrammingMatters.pdf]["Why Functional Programming Matters"]] paper).

**** Sequence Operations
As the title suggests, this sub-section takes on the task of breaking
down programs into sub-tasks using the signal chain metaphor.

***** Exercise 2.33
The best explanation for how to define functions in terms of folds (or
just writing folds in the first place) actually came from the
previously mentioned paper.  All a fold (right fold) does on a list is
replace every 'cons' in the list with the function that is being
folded with and the final 'nil' with the initial element.  For
example, 'fold + 0 '(1 2 3) transforms the list like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 '()))) -> (+ 1 (+ 2 (+ 3 0)))
#+END_SRC

In the first expression, we merely want to replace every
'cons x' with a 'cons (p x)'. Show the resulting expression
is:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (map p sequence)
  (accumulate (lambda (x y) (cons (p x) y) nil sequence))
#+END_SRC

In the second expression, we want the cons to remain unchanged.
However, in order to append the lists, the final '() in seq1 must be
replaced by the entire seq2.  Thus the expression becomes:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (append seq1 seq2)
  (accumulate cons seq1 seq1))
#+END_SRC

Finally, for the last expression, each cons must be replaced with '+',
each non-nil element with 1 and the final 'nil' with 0.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (length sequence)
  (accumulate (lambda (x y) (+ 1 y)) 0 sequence))
#+END_SRC

***** Exercise 2.34
Just as was done in the previous exercise, we need to replace the
conses in the list in order to perform the fold.  The following should
do the trick:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (horner-eval x coefficient-sequence)
  (accumulate (lambda (this-coeff higher-terms)
                (+ this-coeff
                   (* x
                      higher-terms)))
              0
              coefficient-sequence))
#+END_SRC

***** Exercise 2.35
Using the 'replace cons' metaphor, if we replace all conses that are
themselves pairs with a recursive call to count-leaves, and all
non-pairs with '1', it will successfully calculate the number of
leaves in any tree:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (count-leaves t)
  (accumulate + 
              0
              (map (lambda (x)
                     (if (pair? x)
                         (count-leaves x)
                         1))
                   t)))
#+END_SRC

***** Exercise 2.36
I had to stare at an open buffer for a few minutes until the
solution for this one hit me.  Since we're accumulating only the first
element of every subsequence at a time, we just have to map the car
function on the sequence of sequences, pass that to the normal
accumulate function, the pass the result of mapping the cdr to the
sequence of sequences to the accumulate-n function (consing these two
in the process).  Add, rinse, repeat.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (accumulate-n op init seqs)
  (if (null? (car seqs))
      nil
      (cons (accumulate op init (map car seqs))
            (accumulate-n op init (map cdr seqs)))))
#+END_SRC

***** Exercise 2.37
These aren't too bad if you're familiar with some standard matrix
operations.

In order to define the matrix-vector product, we need to map the
vector to every row of the matrix and perform a dot product.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (matrix-*-vector m v)
  (map (lambda (w) (dot-product v w)) m))
#+END_SRC

For the next operation, we need to cons each element in each row of
the matrix, with elements in other rows in the same column.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (transpose mat)
  (accumulate-n cons nil mat))
#+END_SRC

For the final expression, in order to perform the matrix-matrix
product, we simply need to transform the matrix to the right, then map
each row in the left, to a dot product with each row in the now
transposed matrix to the right.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (matrix-*-matrix m n)
  (let ((cols (transpose n)))
    (map (lambda (row-m)
           (map (lambda (row-n)
                  (dot-product row-m row-n))
                cols))
         m)))
#+END_SRC

***** Exercise 2.38
The values for the expressions are:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(fold-right / 1 (list 1 2 3)) => (/ 1 (/ 2 (/ 3 1))) => 3/2
(fold-left / 1 (list 1 2 3)) => (/ (/ (/ 1 1) 2) 3) => 3/2
(fold-right list nil (list 1 2 3)) => (list 1 (list 2 (list 3 nil)))
(fold-left list nil (list 1 2 3)) => (list (list (list 1 nil) 2) 3)
#+END_SRC

From the expressions above, we see that the types of expressions that
are invariant over folds tend to be those that are commutative. The
above example for is actually a bit of a misnomer since 

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(fold-left / 2 '(1 2 3 4) => 1/12 != 3/4 <= (fold-right / 2 '(1 2 3 4))
#+END_SRC

However, using + we can see that:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(fold-left + 1 '(1 2 3 4)) => (+ (+ (+ (+ 1 1) 2) 3) 4) = (+ 4 (+ 3 (+ 2 (+ 1 1)))) <= (fold-right + 1 '(1 2 3 4))
#+END_SRC

This is of course due to the fact that (+ a b) == (+ b a). thus for
all all op such that (op a b) == (op b a), foldr will produce the same
result as foldl.

***** Exercise 2.39
It immediately comes to mind that we should use some sort of list
operation (no duh) like cons or list, since we're not reducing, but
merely manipulating the form of the list.  I generally find right
folds to be a bit easier to grasp conceptually, since they generally
don't change the structure of the list, so we'll start there.

In order to reverse the entire list, at each step in the fold we can
simply reverse the order of the parameters to the lambda function and
cons them.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (reverse sequence)
  (fold-right (lambda (x y) (cons y x)) nil sequence))
#+END_SRC 

We can do a similar thing with the left fold, but since at each step
the fold is taking the previous result and placing it in the right
argument of op with the next element of the list into the left
argument, if we instead use list with the arguments reversed, we gain
the desired procedure (that's one hell of a run-on sentence).

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (reverse sequence)
  (fold-left (lambda (x y) (list y x)) nil sequence))
#+END_SRC 

**** Nested Mappings
This section covers more on sequence operations, mainly on the subject
of nested mappings and their applications.

***** Exercise 2.40
I'm not completely sure why they stuck this one in here, mainly since
they did the work for us at the very beginning of the sub-section
(perhaps to further illustrate the power of modular programs).

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (unique-pairs n)
  (flatmap (lambda (i)
             (map (lambda (j)
                    (list i j))
                  (enumerate-interval 1 (- i 1))))
           (enumerate-interval 1 n)))
#+END_SRC

And prime-pairs becomes:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (prime-sum-pairs n)
  (map make-pair-sum
       (filter prime-sum? (unique-pairs n))))
#+END_SRC

***** Exercise 2.41
You can guess the structure of this one pretty easily, though it
unintuitively (at least for me at first) requires two flatmaps, with
the last one being the only normal map.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (unique-triples n)
  (flatmap (lambda (i)
             (flatmap (lambda (j)
                        (map (lambda (k)
                               (list i j k))
                             (enumerate-interval 1 (- j 1))))
                      (enumerate-interval 1 (- i 1))))
           (enumerate-interval 1 n)))
#+END_SRC

***** Exercise 2.42
I'm actually pretty stoked about this problem, even though took me an
embarrassing amount of time to complete. But I completed it without
help nonetheless. My solution is something, I think, that the authors
didn't intend (since both my versions of the functions adjoin-position
and safe? don't actually require the input k, but I included it anyway
in order to stick with the interface presented in the book). Anyway,
onto the solution.

I tested a few of the initial solutions by visual inspection alone.
But upon visiting the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle][wiki page]] on the subject, I discovered that
there are only 92 solutions out of the total possible 4,426,165,368
(the total number of ways to arrange 8 queens on the board). And lo
and behold, my version yields 92 solutions! This is of course not a
rigorous proof by any measure of the word, but good enough for me.

I think the canonical way to do this (judging by the k variable in the
functions) was to generate and keep in memory many kxk boards full of
whatever null representation the programmer chose to user, and by
inserting values into the proper rows, the solution is generated.
However, the way that came to my mind was to simply cons new rows onto
the boards as they came up. That way, things become a bit simpler
since there's now no need to deal with any unnecessary null rows in
the board.

For the empty board representation, we simply need a list of the null
list.  Thus the following definition works nicely:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define empty-board nil)
#+END_SRC

Next, the safe? method needs to check all of the columns and diagonals
in the previous rows for any intersections (the way the rows are
generated guarantees that there will be no conflict there).

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (safe? k positions)
  (define (ones-position row)
    (if (= 1 (car row))
        0
        (+ 1 (ones-position (cdr row)))))
  
  (define (check-column check rest)
    (let ((check-position (ones-position check)))
      (null? (filter (lambda (row)
                       (= (ones-position row)
                          check-position))
                     rest))))

  (define (check-diagonal check rest)
    (let ((check-position (ones-position check)))
      (define (diag-helper rest count)
        (if (null? rest)
            #t
            (let ((current-row (car rest)))
              (if (or (= check-position
                         (+ (ones-position current-row) count))
                      (= check-position
                         (- (ones-position current-row) count)))
                  #f
                  (diag-helper (cdr rest) (+ count 1))))))
      (diag-helper rest 1)))
  
  (let ((check-row (car positions))
        (rest (cdr positions)))
    (and (check-column check-row rest)
         (check-diagonal check-row rest))))
#+END_SRC

I know of a few ways implement this using built-in functions, but I
thought I'd try to stick with only those functions that have been
introduced in the book thus far.

Finally, I had to implement the adjoin-positions function as a
closure, since it needs the board-size definition from the queens
function. All adjoin-positions needs to really do is cons new rows
with every possible queen position onto the existing partially-formed
boards.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (queens board-size)
  
  (define (adjoin-position new-row k rest-of-queens)
    (define (make-row-with-k n k)
      (cond ((<= n 0) '())
            ((= (- n 1)
                (- n k)) (cons 1
                               (make-row-with-k (- n 1)
                                                (- k 1))))
            (else (cons 0 
                        (make-row-with-k (- n 1)
                                         (- k 1))))))
    (cons (make-row-with-k board-size new-row)
          rest-of-queens))
  
  (define (queen-cols k)  
    (if (= k 0)
        (list empty-board)
        (filter
         (lambda (positions) (safe? k positions))
         (flatmap
          (lambda (rest-of-queens)
            (map (lambda (new-row)
                   (adjoin-position new-row k rest-of-queens))
                 (enumerate-interval 1 board-size)))
          (queen-cols (- k 1))))))
  (queen-cols board-size))
#+END_SRC

I'm sure that there are much shorter ways to solve this problem, but
I'm pretty happy with the way it performs (it can generate the 10x10
solution in a second or so), so I'll stand behind it.

*** 2.2.4 Example: A Picture Language
   
**** The picture language
This is how abstraction works at its best.  The simply fact that the
only object we have to deal with is the 'painter' shows how powerful
of a concept it can be.

***** Exercise 2.44
The up-split is almost identical in form to the right split, with the
interchange of the beside and below functions. 

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (up-split painter n)
  (if (= n 0)
      painter
      (let ((smaller (up-split (- n 1))))
        (below painter (beside smaller smaller)))))
#+END_SRC
     
**** Higher-order operations
This section extends the previous section by introducing a couple of
higher-order functions (one of them written by us in the next
exercise) that abstract most of our previously written functions.
    
***** Exercise 2.45
As was done with square-of-four, we need to create a function that
returns a function.  However unlike square-of-four, the function that
we return needs to take in two inputs: painter and n.
     
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (split left-op right-op)
  (lambda (painter n)
    (if (= n 0)
        painter
        (let ((smaller (split (- n 1))))
          (left-op painter (right-op smaller smaller))))))
#+END_SRC     
     
**** Frames
***** Exercise 2.46
The most natural way to represent a vector is a simple list.  Thus our
constructor becomes:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (make-vect vx vy)
  (list vx vy))
#+END_SRC

To get the x coordinate, simply get the car of the list:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (xcor-vect v)
  (car v))
#+END_SRC

To get the y coordinate, simply get the cadr of the list:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (ycor-vect v)
  (cadr v))
#+END_SRC

Using similar list operations, as well as our previously defined
definitions, we can construct the add-vect, sub-vect and scale-vect
operations:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (add-vect v1 v2)
  (list (+ (xcor-vect v1)
           (xcor-vect v2))
        (+ (ycor-vect v1)
           (ycor-vect v2))))

(define (sub-vect v1 v2)
  (list (- (xcor-vect v1)
           (xcor-vect v2))
        (- (ycor-vect v1)
           (ycor-vect v2))))

(define (scale-vect s v)
  (list (* s (xcor-vect v))
        (* s (ycor-vect v))))
#+END_SRC

***** Exercise 2.47
For the first constructor, the selectors are:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (edge1-frame frame)
  (car frame))

(define (edge2-frame frame)
  (cadr frame))

(define (origin-frame frame)
  (caddr frame))
#+END_SRC

For the second:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (edge1-frame frame)
  (car frame))

(define (edge2-frame frame)
  (cadr frame))

(define (origin-frame frame)
  (cddr frame))
#+END_SRC
**** Painters
***** Exercise 2.48
The most natural way to represent a segment is a list of two vectors.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (make-segment sv ev)
  (list sv ev))
#+END_SRC

The selectors then become:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (start-segment segment)
  (car segment))

(define (end-segment segment)
  (cadr segment))
#+END_SRC

***** Exercise 2.49

a. In order to outline the frame we need four vectors, one pointing
to each corner of the parallelogram that outlines the frame.  I've
used let* here, even though I don't think it's been define in the book
(you can do it with a normal let, but it would take four nested lets).
If you're unfamiliar with the various let special forms that scheme
offers, I recommend reading up on them [[http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/dorai/t-y-scheme/t-y-scheme-Z-H-7.html#node_chap_5][here]].

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (paint-outline frame)
  (let* ((origin (origin-frame frame))
         (edge1 (add-vect origin (edge1-frame frame)))
         (edge2 (add-vect origin (edge2-frame frame)))
         (opposite-origin (add-vect edge1 edge2)))
    ((segments->painter (list (make-segment origin edge1)
                              (make-segment origin edge2)
                              (make-segment edge1 opposite-origin)
                              (make-segment edge2 opposite-origin)))
     frame)))
#+END_SRC

b. Here we only need to connect the vectors constructed in the let* of
the previous exercise in a slightly different manner.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (paint-x frame)
  (let* ((origin (origin-frame frame))
         (edge1 (add-vect origin (edge1-frame frame)))
         (edge2 (add-vect origin (edge2-frame frame)))
         (opposite-origin (add-vect edge1 edge2)))
    ((segments->painter (list (make-segment origin opposite-origin)
                              (make-segment edge1 edge2)))
     frame)))
#+END_SRC

c. To find the midpoint vector of two vectors we merely apply the transformation:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
midpoint (x1, y1) (x2, y2) -> ((x1 + x2) / 2, (y1 + y2) / 2)
#+END_SRC

Or in terms of scheme.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (midpoint v1 v2)
  (scale-vect 0.5 (add-vect v1 v2)))
#+END_SRC

The two let forms here are unnecessary, but are there to make the
expression more readable.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (paint-diamond frame)
  (let* ((origin (origin-frame frame))
         (edge1 (add-vect origin (edge1-frame frame)))
         (edge2 (add-vect origin (edge2-frame frame)))
         (opposite-origin (add-vect edge1 edge2)))
    (let ((origin-edge1 (midpoint origin edge1))
          (origin-edge2 (midpoint origin edge2))
          (edge1-opp (midpoint edge1 opposite-origin))
          (edge2-opp (midpoint edge2 opposite-origin)))
      
      ((segments->painter (list (make-segment origin-edge1 origin-edge2)
                                (make-segment origin-edge1 edge1-opp)
                                (make-segment origin-edge2 edge2-opp)
                                (make-segment edge1-opp edge2-opp)))
       frame))))
